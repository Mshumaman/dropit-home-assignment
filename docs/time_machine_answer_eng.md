# Answer to the Question - Time Travel (in English)

I wasn't sure whether to write the answer in Hebrew or English, so I'm attaching the answer in English here.

## If I Could Go Back in Time

If I had to go back to a point in time for 24 hours, I would most likely choose a day in 2002. The reason is that this period feels simpler compared to today (or at least that’s how it seems now). During that time, the cultural and sports heroes I grew up with were at their peak. Watching the Lakers with Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant in their prime, for example, sounds like a dream.

Additionally, at that time, I was young and didn’t have the responsibilities and worries I have today. My family life was that of a child, not a parent, and I had the freedom to do what I wanted, to make choices that later turned out to be significant. Having the chance to relive such a time feels like a great privilege.

Inspired by the movie *About Time*, where the protagonist discovers at 18 that he can travel back in time within his own life by thinking about the moment while standing in a closet, I find the idea of traveling within your own timeline, rather than to a distant past or future, a humble yet magical concept. Often, we search for things outside ourselves that already exist within us but are forgotten.
